Instructions
============

1. Install layman if you haven't already::

    # emerge layman

2. Add the following line to the list of overlays in
   /etc/layman/layman.conf (i.e. underneath the line that
   starts with "overlays : http...")::

    http://github.com/vangale/gentoo-python-django-overlay/tree/master%2Flayman.xml?raw=true

3. Run layman sync and add the overlay::

    # layman -S
    # layman -a python-django

4. If this was your first layman overlay add the following line to
   the bottom of /etc/make.conf::

    source /usr/portage/local/layman/make.conf

Disclaimer
==========

Since I'm not a Gentoo dev, I don't pay close attention to any changes in
the way ebuilds are written, especially Python ebuilds.  So please use these
with that understanding. Some of these projects that I include are not well
maintained and are sketchy code, which means I might not even be using the
project anymore and won't update the ebuild.

Finally, I probably won't do any more Django ebuilds as I now prefer to
do svn checkouts in the root directory of every project I'm working on. In
other words like the ./external_apps/svn.externals in pinax/django-hotclub.
